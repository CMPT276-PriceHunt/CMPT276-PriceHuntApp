Retrospective:
Things that went well:<br/> - We were able to create the very outer shell of the app,<br/>
                       - Login Page is working well with users able to input username and password (although not useful yet)<br/>
                       - Login page is very minimalistic right now, but can easily be changed for iteration 2<br/>
                       - Wishlist, able to add items with description and picture<br/>
                       - I'd say our team has been following the AGILE development method quite well so far, we're not doing our project per iteration,<br/> 
                       - rather were working on every single part of the app slowly, and building our way up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things that did not go well:<br/> - The wishlist isn't working to how we want it right now,<br/>
                             - Since we don't have any items yet to add to a wishlist, we have to add pictures ourselves by<br/> 
                             - Taking a picture in the emulator, then we can add a photo<br/>
                             - The wishlist is still very bare bones, and needs a lot of development<br/>
                             - Also we forgot to add a button for going back to the previous page after viewing wishlist<br/>
                             - Login page is not fully working yet either, need to make it so that users can sign up first and add their users and password to be actual data.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things to improve on:<br/> - Utilizing git properly, I don't think we used it properly as we created separate branches,<br/>
                      - without first pulling from the main branch, this is because when we first started, we didn't have anything in the main branch<br/>
                      - this made merging branches a lot more tedious.<br/>

Test Cases:<br/>
