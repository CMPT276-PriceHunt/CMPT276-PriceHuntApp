Retrospective:
Things that went well: - We were able to create the very outer shell of the app, 
                       - Login Page is working well with users able to input username and password (although not useful yet)
                       - Login page is very minimalistic right now, but can easily be changed for iteration 2
                       - Wishlist, able to add items with description and picture
                       - I'd say our team has been following the AGILE development method quite well so far, we're not doing our project per iteration, 
                       - rather were working on every single part of the app slowly, and building our way up.



Things that did not go well: - The wishlist isn't working to how we want it right now,
                             - Since we don't have any items yet to add to a wishlist, we have to add pictures ourselves by 
                             - Taking a picture in the emulator, then we can add a photo
                             - The wishlist is still very bare bones, and needs a lot of development
                             - Also we forgot to add a button for going back to the previous page after viewing wishlist

                             - Login page is not fully working yet either, need to make it so that users can sign up first and add their users and password to be actual data.

Things to improve on: - Utilizing git properly, I don't think we used it properly as we created separate branches,
                      - without first pulling from the main branch, this is because when we first started, we didn't have anything in the main branch
                      - this made merging branches a lot more tedious.
