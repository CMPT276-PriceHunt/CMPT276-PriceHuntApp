Retrospective:
Things that went well:<br/> - We were able to create the very outer shell of the app,<br/>
                       - Login Page is working well with users able to input username and password (although not useful yet)<br/>
                       - Login page is very minimalistic right now, but can easily be changed for iteration 2<br/>
                       - Wishlist, able to add items with description and picture<br/>
                       - I'd say our team has been following the AGILE development method quite well so far, we're not doing our project per iteration,<br/> 
                       - rather were working on every single part of the app slowly, and building our way up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things that did not go well:<br/> - The wishlist isn't working to how we want it right now,<br/>
                             - Since we don't have any items yet to add to a wishlist, we have to add pictures ourselves by<br/> 
                             - Taking a picture in the emulator, then we can add a photo<br/>
                             - The wishlist is still very bare bones, and needs a lot of development<br/>
                             - Also we forgot to add a button for going back to the previous page after viewing wishlist<br/>
                             - Found out that Figma UI could not be imported to Android Studio 1-to-1. This caused the UI to <br/>
                             - be remade from scratch with barely enough time. Then once it was complete, it was not able <br/>
                             - to navigate to the already created pages. Causing another remake. <br/>
                             - There were some issues in git where it would not merge cleanly, <br/>
                             - it required the branches to be merged locally on one, then pushed to main.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things to improve on:<br/> - Utilizing git properly, I don't think we used it properly as we created separate branches,<br/>
                      - without first pulling from the main branch, this is because when we first started, we didn't have anything in the main branch<br/>
                      - this made merging branches a lot more tedious.<br/>
                      - Improvement of the UI in general. Some examples include a consistent design throughout, <br/>
                      - proper linking between pages, and more interactables on the home page. <br/>
                      - Having proper dummy data to test the wishlist implementation. <br/>
                      - Having clothing data already on app instead of having to add it on our own. <br/>
                      - Login page is not fully working yet either, need to make it so that users can sign up first and add their users and password to be actual data.<br/>

Running Instructions:
- Ensure the latest version of Android Studio is installed
- Download the zip files
- Extract the files
- Open Android Studio
- Select Open a Project, then find the extracted folder
- On the top left, go to Build, then Make Project
- On the top middle, select Add Configuration
- Select Edit Configurations
- Add new configuration
- Select Android App
- Name config if needed
- Set the module to LoginApp.app.main
- Click OK
- Run the app by clicking the Run icon beside the config name on the top bar
- Close the app by swiping up the bar on the bottom
- Add the Camera app somewhere visible on the emulator (swipe up on the home screen, then hold the camera icon and drag it to the home screen)
- Take a photo so that it is possible to add an item to the wishlist
- **Currently the app follows a linear structure of login -> profile -> wishlist -> home page**
- Might need to delete line 50 and 51 then add this within dependencies of /app/build.gradle.kts{
