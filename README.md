# Retrospective:

### Things that went well:
- The navigation bar now links to the correct pages
- There is now a feature to have multiple wishlists
- There is a way to edit your personal information
- Signing up and using the username and password is now required to enter the app

### Things that did not go well:
- The navigation bar now uses activities instead of fragments but that took a while to solve
- Not enough time to work on this project during midterm season, so we were not able to implement as many features as we want


### Things to improve on:
- Including a consistent UI language
- Having pre-existing clothing items that can be added to the wishlists
- Have the image buttons on the home page actually lead to a page of those items
-
