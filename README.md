# Retrospective:

### Things that went well:
- One issue we faced was having our navigation bar sectioned off from the rest of the pages, in this iteration it is now properly linked and leads to the correct pages
- There is now a feature to have multiple wishlists
- There is a way to edit your personal information
- Signing up and using the username and password is now required to enter the app

### Things that did not go well:
- The navigation bar now uses activities instead of fragments but that took a while to solve
- Not enough time to work on this project during midterm season, so we were not able to implement as many features as we want


### Things to improve on:
- Including a consistent UI language
- Having pre-existing clothing items that can be added to the wishlists
- Have the image buttons on the home page actually lead to a page of those items
-
